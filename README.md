# ENS Contract Event Visualizer
## (Slock.it Programming Task)

The [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains/) offers a secure and decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names. The objective is to write a test application to investigate or list or visualize the ENS contract events of the past (e.g. the last 1 or 2 days) focussing in particular on the event for registered names:
```
NameRegistered (string name, bytes32 label, address owner, uint256 cost, uint256 expires)
```
The ENS-Registrar Contract address is `0xF0AD5cAd05e10572EfcEB849f6Ff0c68f9700455`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
